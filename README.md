# random-challenges

This is a place to put all of the random challenges I want to do on my own computer when they don't have a project to live in.

## Testing

Run `npm run test` to run all the tests and check my work. Alternatively, run `vitest run <filename>` for a specific file. See [the vitest cli docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html) for more options.
